# Colour calibration

A colour chart (Spyder CheckrÂ® 24 card, Datacolor, NJ, USA) was scanned in a flatbed scanner (HP Scanjet G4010) at a resolution of 1,200 dpi under the same settings as the seeds. The image of the colour chart is used to calculate a colour conversion matrix, which is then applied to all acquired images for optimal colour reproduction.
