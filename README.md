# Colour calibration

The colour chart Spyder CheckrÂ® 24 card (Datacolor, NJ, USA) is used for colour calibration of images. All images were acquired with a flatbed scanner (HP Scanjet G4010) at a resolution of 1,200 dpi at the same colour and light settings. The code creates a colour conversion matrix, which is then applied to images.
